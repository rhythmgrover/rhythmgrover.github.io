                                    <p>Note that as a rule, from 2024 I do not host short-term visiting student interns because there is simply not enough time to get tangible results to make the joint commitment worthwhile. As with all rules, I am willing to consider an exception under the right circumstances. </p>

I am always looking for talented, dedicated and friendly individuals to join my research group. This can be done at a variety of levels: PhD student. 
Get in touch to discuss any of these.
